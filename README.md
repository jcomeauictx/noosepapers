# The Noose Papers

This is a project for a website and (possibly) physical newspaper that will be
used as a prod to an increasingly apathetic public, regarding the unprecedented
attack on personal freedoms that occurred during the so-called coronavirus
"pandemic", particularly in the United States, which has those freedoms codified
in its Declaration of Independence as well as in the Bill of Rights. The goal is
to hold those most guilty to account, not with "nooses" in the literal sense,
but with the strictest possible punishments available under the law.

Will probably be using these folks for printing, if this ever comes to fruition: <https://makemynewspaper.com/specifications/>. Their pre-sales support was quick and accurate, and their pricing is competitive.

Considering using gothic fonts from <https://www.dafont.com/dieter-steffmann.d253>, labeled "100% Free" on the linked page. "Cloister Black" will likely be used
for the first edition of the Noosepaper.

The New York Times, a broadsheet, has 6 columns to a page. The Post and Daily News, tabloids, have 5 columns.
